# @schemeless/event-store-react-native

React Native compatible build of the [`@schemeless/event-store`](../event-store) runtime. It mirrors the Node.js implementation but swaps the internal queue implementation to [`react-native-better-queue`](https://github.com/YahyaASadiq/react-native-better-queue) so it can run inside React Native apps without relying on Node.js file system primitives.

## Usage

Install the package from npm and initialise it the same way you would the Node.js runtime:

```ts
import { makeEventStore } from '@schemeless/event-store-react-native';
```

All public APIs match the original package, so existing event flows and adapters can be reused. The only difference is the queue dependency, which now targets React Native environments.

### React Native prerequisites

Some consumers rely on `crypto.getRandomValues` (for example the `uuid` package). React Native apps should polyfill it with [`react-native-get-random-values`](https://github.com/Luka967/react-native-get-random-values):

```sh
npm install react-native-get-random-values
npx pod-install
```

If you use the Expo managed workflow you will see "CocoaPods is not supported in this project"â€”that is expected and safe to ignore.

Then import the polyfill once at the root of your app (e.g. `index.js`):

```js
import 'react-native-get-random-values';
```

After this, libraries that depend on `crypto.getRandomValues` (such as `uuid`) continue to work as expected.

## Development

This package is generated from the Node.js implementation and will be kept in sync as part of the monorepo. Build scripts and test commands mirror the original package:

```bash
yarn workspace @schemeless/event-store-react-native compile
yarn workspace @schemeless/event-store-react-native test
```
